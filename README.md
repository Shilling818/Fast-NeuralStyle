# Fast-NeuralStyle
Tensorflow version for the paper 'Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution'
In the 'net.py', you may use vgg16_tf.mat. You can download the standard VGG-16 weights and biases, and then compress them into a mat using Matlab.
My propose is to transform a optical image into a SAR image. These two type images can be considered as two kinds of style.
